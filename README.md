# Flutter UI Kit - Banking App

This project is a **UI kit** built with **Flutter**, inspired by a design from [**Dribbble**](https://dribbble.com/). The UI represents a clean and modern banking app interface, but it's important to note that this is just the **frontend/UI** with no backend or functionality implemented.

## 🎨 Features

- **Clean design**: Simple and intuitive layout for a smooth user experience.
- **Flutter implementation**: Built entirely using Flutter’s powerful widget system.
- **Banking app elements**: 
  - Balance overview screen
  - Transaction history
  - Transfer interface with selectable contacts
  - Spending chart and statistics
